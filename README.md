## Weather App

This SPA reflects the weather in the particular city.

4 components were implemented: <br>
    `<ErrorBoundry/>` and `<ErrorIndicator>` to detect the errors; <br>
    `<SearchPanel>` to search the weather in the particular city (Latin only supported); <br>
    `<WeatherPanel>` to represent relevant data about the weather.
    
This SPA has two themes: light and dark. Switching between themes depends on the current users time zone. This feature were implemented by function `GetTheme`

The city established by default is `Samara`. The city can be easily changed  in main component `<App>` state 

It is developed specially for SimbirSoft Frontend workshop.
